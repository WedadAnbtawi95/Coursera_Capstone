# Coursera_Capstone

The goal is to help investors to decide where to open a potential new restaurant in Toronto. The data provided will be the income and population per neighborhood. Also, the surrounded restaurants that are considered competitors will be shown. The final project will help the investors to check where to open a profitable new restaurant.

The income and population per neighborhood in Toronto will be taken from Toronto's Neighbourhood Profiles 2016. This data will be combined with Foursquare API to collect restaurants that are competitors in the same neighborhoods.

Toronto's Neighbourhood Profiles data is publicly available at this website: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles
